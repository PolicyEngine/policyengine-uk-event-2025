Max Ghenis and Nikhil Woodruff present PolicyEngine's AI roadmap across three pillars: building software, improving models, and augmenting software.

For building software, they announce the beta launch of the policyengine-claude plugin at github.com/policyengine/policyengine-claude, providing custom commands, specialised agents, and domain knowledge for PolicyEngine development. They demonstrate a scientific approach to rules-as-code automation: creating golden pull requests with manually verified code, using AI to generate implementations from policy descriptions, then iteratively adjusting prompts to maximise alignment between AI-produced and golden code.

For improving models, they present two priorities: continuing US local area modelling work with enhanced calibration methods while transferring these to UK constituencies and local authorities, and exploring synthetic panel generation to enable lifetime program simulation (such as US Social Security solvency) where current cross-sectional survey data provides only snapshots.

For augmenting software, they preview PolicyEngine App v2's natural language capabilities: LLM extraction to pull relevant insights from the database based on natural language queries, and flexible visualisations to present insights through adaptive charts on an extensible report canvas. The presentation concludes with reflections on AI's promise—enabling unprecedented policy analysis that is more comprehensive, accurate, and accessible—balanced against challenges as AI transforms society through changing income patterns and creating new demands for policy research aligned with societal values.
