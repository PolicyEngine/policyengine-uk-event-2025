The PolicyEngine team demonstrates their multi-agent AI research workflow using Claude Code. PolicyEngine has configured specialized agents for data fetching, Python script writing, and report generation with Plotly visualisations. The demo shows real-time policy analysis through natural language requests.

The team discusses successes and limitations: multi-agent workflows excel at standard distributional analyses while facing challenges with complex benefit interactions. They announce the forthcoming policyengine-claude plugin, incorporating Anthropic's Skills ecosystem and Model Context Protocol. The team emphasizes AI handling routine analyses while human researchers focus on policy expertise and methodological choices.
