David Trimmer and Daphne Hansell demonstrate PolicyEngine US's household-level analysis tools through two recent applications.

Trimmer presents the household-by-household interactive for the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), which allows users to explore the legislation's effects on over 40,000 representative households using PolicyEngine's Enhanced Current Population Survey data. The interactive's "Get Random Household" function reveals how the same policy affects different families across America's diverse population, with each household weighted by population representation.

Hansell demonstrates the enhanced ACA subsidy tool, showing how the platform enables users to understand health insurance subsidy impacts at the individual household level. These tools make policy impacts tangible by showing real effects on specific family types rather than aggregate statistics alone.
