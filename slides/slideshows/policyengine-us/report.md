Max Ghenis presents PolicyEngine's US operations, which expanded rapidly in 2024 to achieve comprehensive coverage of American tax and benefit policy. A flagship achievement was the launch of the household-by-household interactive for the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), which allowed users to explore the legislation's effects on over 40,000 representative households using PolicyEngine's Enhanced Current Population Survey data. Ghenis demonstrates the interactive's "Get Random Household" function, which reveals how the same policy affects different families across America's diverse population, with each household weighted by population representation to ensure realistic coverage. This capability showcases PolicyEngine's ability to deliver real-time, detailed analysis of complex legislation in ways that make policy impacts tangible and accessible.

The presentation highlights PolicyEngine US's comprehensive scope, achieved in 2024: federal tax and benefit programs including SNAP, TANF, childcare subsidies, and housing assistance; complete income tax models for all 50 states and DC; and specialized tools like the SALT-AMT calculator and GiveCalc for charitable giving analysis. Ghenis showcases the Enhanced Current Population Survey, which integrates IRS data and Congressional Budget Office forecasts using machine learning to enable accurate tax-benefit microsimulation. He discusses PolicyEngine's analysis of numerous Congressional proposals including the American Family Act and Tax Relief for Workers Act, partnerships with organizations like the Niskanen Center for Child Tax Credit research, and state-level work in Montana, Utah, New York, and Louisiana. The presentation demonstrates how PolicyEngine US handles the complexity of multi-jurisdictional American fiscal policy—from federal-state interactions to local tax variations—establishing the platform as a leading resource for evidence-based policy analysis across all levels of government. Ghenis notes recognition from the academic community, including presentations at the National Tax Association, APPAM, and universities including UC Berkeley and Northwestern.

This expansion has been supported by major grants from leading foundations and agencies. The National Science Foundation awarded PolicyEngine $300,000 through its Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems (POSE) program to strengthen organizational infrastructure and community engagement around economic policy analysis tools. Arnold Ventures has provided multiple awards supporting state and congressional district policy breakdowns, specialized calculators for SALT and AMT policies, and labor supply response modeling. MyFriendBen contracted PolicyEngine to power its benefit eligibility screener with comprehensive API support, while NEO Philanthropy provided general operating support through its Economic Mobility & Opportunity Fund. These partnerships demonstrate growing recognition of PolicyEngine's role in democratizing sophisticated policy analysis across the United States.
