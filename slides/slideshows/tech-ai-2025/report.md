Nikhil Woodruff explores how PolicyEngine leverages artificial intelligence and modern software architecture to transform UK policy analysis. Building on the OpenFisca-Core framework, PolicyEngine has developed a technical stack that processes complex policy simulations in real-time, enabling users to receive instant feedback on reform proposals. Woodruff demonstrates the platform's AI-powered explanation system, launched in 2024, which translates intricate tax and benefit calculations into clear, understandable language—making professional-grade analysis accessible regardless of technical background.

The session addresses the unique challenges of modelling the UK's tax and benefit system, with its complex interactions between means-tested benefits, tax credits, and universal programs. Woodruff explains how PolicyEngine employs machine learning for data enhancement, including addressing the Family Resources Survey's known undersampling of high-income households. He showcases how the platform's Python-based architecture maintains computational efficiency while supporting millions of possible policy configurations, and discusses the technical decisions that enable PolicyEngine to serve both individual users seeking personal calculations and researchers conducting population-wide microsimulation analysis.
