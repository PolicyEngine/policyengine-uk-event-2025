Nikhil Woodruff demonstrates how PolicyEngine uses artificial intelligence and modern software architecture for UK policy analysis. Building on OpenFisca-Core, PolicyEngine processes policy simulations in real-time. Woodruff shows the platform's AI-powered explanation system, launched in 2024, which translates tax and benefit calculations into clear language. He explains how PolicyEngine uses machine learning for data enhancement, addressing the Family Resources Survey's undersampling of high-income households, while maintaining efficiency across millions of policy configurations.
