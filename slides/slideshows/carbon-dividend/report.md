Malcolm Torry, formerly at the Basic Income Earth Network and London School of Economics, presents PolicyEngine's application to carbon tax and dividend proposals, where carbon tax revenue funds unconditional payments. Torry analyses two scenarios: a £100 per tonne tax funding £18.60 per week dividends, and a £200 per tonne tax funding £37.40 per week. While both scenarios redistribute from rich to poor, some low-income households would experience losses. Torry demonstrates how microsimulation informs policy design, showing precisely which households gain and lose under different approaches.
