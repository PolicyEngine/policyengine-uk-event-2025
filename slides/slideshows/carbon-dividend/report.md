Malcolm Torry, formerly General Manager of the Basic Income Earth Network and Senior Visiting Fellow at the London School of Economics, presents PolicyEngine's application to carbon tax and dividend proposals—an approach where carbon tax revenue funds unconditional payments to every individual rather than being used for general government spending. Drawing on PolicyEngine's microsimulation capabilities developed by Nikhil Woodruff, Max Ghenis, and Vahid Ahmadi, Torry analyses two scenarios: a £100 per tonne carbon tax funding an unconditional dividend of £18.60 per week, and a £200 per tonne tax funding £37.40 per week. He explains how carbon dividends address a policy challenge—ensuring that carbon taxes don't reduce household disposable incomes, particularly for lower-income families who spend proportionally more on energy.

The presentation shows how PolicyEngine's microsimulation quantifies distributional impacts: while both carbon tax scenarios redistribute from rich to poor (as wealthy households consume more carbon-intensive goods), the analysis reveals that some low-income households would experience income losses. Torry demonstrates how this distributional analysis can inform policy design, suggesting that a hybrid approach—combining a carbon tax with reforms to existing taxes and benefits—could achieve environmental goals while mitigating impacts on lower-income households. He references his broader Basic Income research using PolicyEngine, which identified schemes meeting specific criteria including revenue neutrality within £2 billion, no more than 2% of low-income households experiencing losses above 5%, and reductions in poverty and inequality. This work demonstrates how microsimulation shows precisely which households gain and lose under different policy designs.
