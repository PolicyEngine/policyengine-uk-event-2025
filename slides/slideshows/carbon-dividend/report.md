Malcolm Torry, formerly General Manager of the Basic Income Earth Network and Senior Visiting Fellow at the London School of Economics, presents PolicyEngine's application to carbon tax and dividend proposals—an innovative approach where carbon tax revenue funds unconditional payments to every individual rather than being used for general government spending. Drawing on PolicyEngine's microsimulation capabilities developed by Nikhil Woodruff, Max Ghenis, and Vahid Ahmadi, Torry analyzes two scenarios: a £100 per tonne carbon tax funding an unconditional dividend of £18.60 per week, and a £200 per tonne tax funding £37.40 per week. He explains how carbon dividends address a critical policy challenge—ensuring that carbon taxes don't reduce household disposable incomes, particularly for lower-income families who spend proportionally more on energy.

The presentation reveals a fundamental tension in climate policy design: while both carbon tax scenarios redistribute from rich to poor (as wealthy households consume more carbon-intensive goods), PolicyEngine's microsimulation shows they would impose large income losses on too many low-income households to be politically feasible. Torry demonstrates how this distributional analysis informs the search for viable solutions, suggesting that a hybrid approach—combining a carbon tax with reforms to existing taxes and benefits—could achieve environmental goals while protecting vulnerable households. He references his broader Basic Income research using PolicyEngine, which identified feasible schemes meeting strict criteria including revenue neutrality within £2 billion, no more than 2% of low-income households experiencing losses above 5%, and substantial reductions in poverty and inequality. This work exemplifies how microsimulation reveals the political economy of climate policy by showing precisely which households win and lose under different policy designs.
