Vahid Ahmadi provides a overview of PolicyEngine UK's modelling scope, detailing the range of tax and benefit rules encoded in the platform. This presentation covers how PolicyEngine captures the full complexity of the UK fiscal system, from income tax and National Insurance to Universal Credit, Council Tax support, childcare programs (Tax-Free Childcare, Extended childcare entitlement, Universal childcare entitlement, Targeted childcare entitlement, and Care to Learn), and numerous other means-tested and universal programs. Ahmadi explains the methodology for maintaining an accurate, up-to-date representation of current policy while preserving the flexibility to simulate any hypothetical reform through the platform's modular architecture built on OpenFisca.

The session explores PolicyEngine's data enhancement capabilities, representing one of its most technically features. Ahmadi details how the platform addresses fundamental challenges in microsimulation: under-sampling of demographic groups and measurement errors including underreporting of income and benefits. Using machine learning techniques—specifically random forest algorithms for imputation and gradient descent optimisation for reweighting—PolicyEngine enhances the Family Resources Survey by fusing it with the Wealth and Assets Survey and Living Costs and Food Survey, correcting underrepresentation of high-income households and significantly reducing deviations from official statistics. He explains the platform's behavioural response modelling, which incorporates key elasticities for income effects on labour supply, substitution effects on labour supply, and capital gains tax responses, with all parameters customisable by users. Ahmadi demonstrates how PolicyEngine's recent Capital Gains Tax analysis showed behavioural modelling projected substantially lower five-year revenue compared to static analysis, illustrating the critical importance of capturing how individuals adjust economic decisions when facing new incentives.
