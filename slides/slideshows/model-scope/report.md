Vahid Ahmadi presents PolicyEngine UK's modelling scope, covering the platform's tax and benefit rules from income tax and National Insurance to Universal Credit, Council Tax support, and childcare programs. Ahmadi explains how PolicyEngine maintains current policy while enabling simulation of hypothetical reforms through its OpenFisca-based architecture.

Ahmadi details PolicyEngine's data enhancement capabilities, addressing under-sampling and measurement errors through machine learning. Using random forest imputation and gradient descent reweighting, PolicyEngine fuses the Family Resources Survey with the Wealth and Assets Survey and Living Costs and Food Survey. He explains behavioural response modelling for labour supply and capital gains tax, noting how PolicyEngine's Capital Gains Tax analysis showed behavioural modelling projected lower five-year revenue than static analysis.
