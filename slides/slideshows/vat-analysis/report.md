Vahid Ahmadi presents PolicyEngine's first application of firm-level microsimulation to UK tax policy, analyzing how VAT threshold changes between £70,000 and £120,000 would affect government revenues and VAT-registered businesses in 2026-27. This groundbreaking work addresses a critical gap in traditional microsimulation models by expanding beyond household-level analysis to incorporate business-side tax impacts. Ahmadi explains the methodology for constructing synthetic firm microdata through multi-objective optimization, calibrated to match both ONS UK Business statistics for overall firm distributions and HMRC VAT statistics for registered businesses. The model captures firms by industry classification, turnover bands, employee counts, and VAT tax liability while protecting sensitive business information.

The presentation showcases validation results showing PolicyEngine's estimates deviate an average of only 12.3% from HMRC's official projections across 2024-29, demonstrating the model's accuracy. Ahmadi reveals key findings from the analysis: raising the threshold to £100,000 would remove approximately 48,000 firms from VAT registration and reduce revenue by £371 million, while a £70,000 threshold would add 109,000 firms and generate £642 million additional revenue. He discusses observed distributions showing density drops above both the £90,000 VAT threshold and the £150,000 VAT Flat Rate Scheme limit. Ahmadi previews upcoming applications of this capability to sector-specific thresholds, phase-in mechanisms, and policies addressing cliff effects where businesses deliberately constrain growth to avoid VAT registration—demonstrating how firm-level microsimulation provides a more complete picture of tax policy impacts.
