Vahid Ahmadi presents PolicyEngine's firm-level microsimulation for VAT policy, analysing threshold changes between £70,000 and £120,000 for 2026-27. Using synthetic firm microdata calibrated to ONS and HMRC statistics, the model captures firms by industry, turnover, employees, and VAT liability.

PolicyEngine's estimates deviate an average of 12.3% from HMRC projections. Raising the threshold to £100,000 would remove 48,000 firms from VAT registration and reduce revenue by £371 million, while a £70,000 threshold would add 109,000 firms and generate £642 million.
