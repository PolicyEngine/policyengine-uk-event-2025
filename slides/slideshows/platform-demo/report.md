Anthony Volk showcases PolicyEngine 2.0 through an interactive demonstration of the comprehensively redesigned platform. Based on user research conducted by partner organisation Citizen Codex, the new design addresses user feedback requesting a more standard, accessible interface with lower experience and domain knowledge thresholds. Volk walks through the reimagined user journey from designing a policy reform to interpreting its economic and distributional impacts, demonstrating how the new interface reduces the time and understanding needed for users to successfully run their first microsimulation.

The demo highlights improvements to the platform's design and functionality, including enhanced visualisation tools, more intuitive navigation reflecting modern web standards, and new features specifically designed to lower barriers for first-time users. Volk demonstrates capabilities such as customising household circumstances to understand policy impacts on specific family types, comparing multiple policy scenarios side-by-side with improved clarity, and using the enhanced API to integrate PolicyEngine analysis into external research workflows. He showcases new features including sign-in functionality for saving and sharing policy scenarios, mobile optimisation for analysis on any device, and increased opportunities for AI integration into the user workflow—demonstrating PolicyEngine's commitment to democratising access to policy analysis tools while maintaining the technical rigour that professional researchers require.
