Max Ghenis moderates a wide-ranging conversation with Arun Advani and Anvar Sarygulov exploring how the UK's evidence ecosystem is evolving as open models, administrative microdata, and artificial intelligence reshape policy analysis. The discussion examines distinct but complementary perspectives: Advani brings insights from cutting-edge academic research using HMRC administrative data at CenTax; Sarygulov represents the Nuffield Foundation's role as a major funder of evidence infrastructure; and Ghenis contributes PolicyEngine's experience building open-source tools that democratise sophisticated microsimulation analysis.

The conversation explores fundamental questions about the changing landscape of evidence-based policymaking. Advani discusses CenTax's research using administrative tax data, including pioneering work on capital gains tax that employs bunching techniques to measure behavioural responses at tax thresholds—examining how individuals adjust their economic decisions when facing nonlinear incentives. He addresses tensions in the policy analysis industry: whilst distributional analysis has become more established, questions about economic growth and dynamic effects remain underexplored. The panel examines barriers to translating academic insights into practical policy tools, the role of administrative data access in enabling rigourous research, and how behavioural modelling—moving beyond static microsimulation to capture how people respond to policy changes—can credibly inform policymaking.

Sarygulov frames these developments within the Nuffield Foundation's new strategic vision for 2025-2030, which commits £150 million over five years to address five major challenges facing UK society. The Foundation's investment in PolicyEngine exemplifies strategic funding for evidence infrastructure—the shared technical platforms, open data, and reusable models that function as public goods. The discussion examines what true transparency means for policy models, whether reproducibility should be a requirement for models used in government, and how funders can support sustainable open-source infrastructure. The panel considers PolicyEngine's expansion to constituency and local-authority-level analysis, exploring how geographically granular evidence could transform debates about fairness and levelling up. Looking toward 2030, the panellists reflect on AI's realistic role in policy analysis—from encoding tax rules to generating distributional impacts—distinguishing genuine progress from overhyped claims, and envisioning how the UK's approach to evidence-based policymaking might evolve to better serve democratic deliberation.
