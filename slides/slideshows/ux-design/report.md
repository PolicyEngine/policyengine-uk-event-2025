Biniam Gebre and MaSara Myers present the extensive user experience research that informed the design of PolicyEngine 2.0. This presentation reveals insights from interviews with policymakers, researchers, journalists, and citizens to understand their needs, pain points, and mental models when engaging with policy analysis tools. The speakers explain how these insights shaped critical design decisions, from information architecture to visual design, ensuring that complex microsimulation results are presented in ways that are both accurate and comprehensible.

The session explores the balance between simplicity and sophistication in policy analysis interfaces, demonstrating how PolicyEngine 2.0 serves both casual users seeking quick policy insights and expert researchers requiring detailed technical outputs. Gebre and Myers showcase specific design patterns developed to make distributional analysis, budget impacts, and household-level effects more intuitive, and discuss ongoing efforts to continuously improve the platform based on user feedback.
