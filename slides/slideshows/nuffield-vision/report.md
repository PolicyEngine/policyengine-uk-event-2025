The Nuffield Foundation's vision for evidence-based policymaking centres on supporting high-quality research that informs better policy decisions. As one of the UK's leading funders of social policy research, the Nuffield Foundation recognises PolicyEngine as a transformative tool that democratises access to sophisticated policy analysis.

Anvar Sarygulov presents the Foundation's new strategic vision for 2025-2030, built around five major questions facing UK society: the social foundations of future economic success; the effect of shifting demographics on communities, public services and finances; the societal and economic impact of the climate transition; the rapid acceleration of science and technological developments; and the challenge of nurturing trust in institutions in polarised times. This ambitious new phase is supported by a £150 million funding commitment—£30 million annually over five years—representing a significant increase from the previous £21 million per year.

Sarygulov explains how the Foundation's support for PolicyEngine aligns with this strategic vision, particularly in building infrastructure that strengthens the evidence base for public policy. The reopened Strategic Fund offers £15 million for transformational research proposals, with grants of £1-3 million available for ambitious projects. The partnership reflects the Foundation's commitment to ensuring that rigourous analysis is accessible to researchers, policymakers, and citizens alike, supporting evidence-based approaches to the UK's most pressing challenges.
