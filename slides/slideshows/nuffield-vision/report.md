The Nuffield Foundation's vision for evidence-based policymaking centres on supporting high-quality research that informs better policy decisions. As one of the UK's leading funders of social policy research, the Nuffield Foundation recognises PolicyEngine as a transformative tool that democratises access to sophisticated policy analysis.

Anvar Sarygulov explains how the Foundation's support enables PolicyEngine UK to expand its capabilities, improve its accuracy, and reach more users. The partnership reflects the Foundation's commitment to building infrastructure that strengthens the evidence base for public policy, ensuring that rigourous analysis is accessible to researchers, policymakers, and citizens alike.
