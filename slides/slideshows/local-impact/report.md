Nikhil Woodruff and Ben Ogorek present PolicyEngine's local area modelling framework, estimating tax and benefit policy impacts at the parliamentary constituency and local authority level. The system reweights Family Resources Survey data to match administrative statistics from HMRC, ONS, ASHE, and the House of Commons Library, using gradient-based optimisation across 11,000 targets covering income, age, and employment patterns.

Woodruff demonstrates the interactive dashboard for exploring local area data and comparing impacts across regions. Applications include enabling MPs to understand constituency-specific effects and helping local authorities assess benefit changes.

Ogorek presents how PolicyEngine US is building upon this infrastructure by cloning households for each local area rather than reweighting. This approach reveals programme participation patterns at the congressional district level, such as food stamp (SNAP) benefits by district. The underlying software powering this capability is being made available for usage beyond PolicyEngine. PolicyEngine plans to incorporate this approach into UK data in 2026, enabling more granular local area analysis.
