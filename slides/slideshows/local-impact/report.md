Nikhil Woodruff presents PolicyEngine's local area modelling framework, estimating tax and benefit policy impacts at the parliamentary constituency and local authority level. The system reweights Family Resources Survey data to match administrative statistics from HMRC, ONS, ASHE, and the House of Commons Library, using gradient-based optimisation across 11,000 targets covering income, age, and employment patterns.

Woodruff demonstrates the interactive dashboard for exploring local area data and comparing impacts across regions. Applications include enabling MPs to understand constituency-specific effects and helping local authorities assess benefit changes. The framework enables evidence-based discussions accounting for regional variation in economic circumstances and demographics.
