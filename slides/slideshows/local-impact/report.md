Nikhil Woodruff presents PolicyEngine's groundbreaking local area modeling framework, which estimates the impact of UK tax and benefit policies at the level of parliamentary constituencies and local authorities—a capability that transforms how policymakers understand the geographical distribution of policy effects. The system reweights national Family Resources Survey data to match administrative statistics on income, employment, and population for each local area, creating household weights that maintain consistency with national totals while reflecting local characteristics. Woodruff explains the sophisticated methodology that integrates data from HMRC, ONS, ASHE, and the House of Commons Library, using gradient-based optimization to calibrate over 11,000 targets covering income brackets, age bands, and employment patterns across all constituencies and local authorities.

The presentation demonstrates the interactive dashboard that allows users to explore local area data and compare impacts across regions, supporting analysis of income, consumption, wealth, taxes, benefits, and fiscal impacts at the constituency and local authority level. Woodruff showcases practical applications, including how Members of Parliament can understand how proposed reforms would affect their specific constituencies, and how local authorities can assess the implications of benefit changes for their communities. He explains the technical challenges of producing geographically granular analysis while maintaining statistical validity, and demonstrates how this local dimension adds crucial context to national policy debates. The framework represents a significant advance in UK policy analysis, enabling evidence-based discussions that account for regional variation in economic circumstances, demographic composition, and policy impacts.
