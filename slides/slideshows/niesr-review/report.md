Max Mosley, Senior Economist at the New Economics Foundation and formerly at NIESR, presents how PolicyEngine supported NIESR's UK Living Standards Review 2025. The review found the poorest households in Slovenia and Malta are now better off than the poorest in the UK, real income growth has been among the slowest in Europe, and the UK ranks as neither a high wage nor high welfare country.

Mosley demonstrates how PolicyEngine enabled NIESR to analyse policy interventions, particularly poverty reduction measures. Analysis showed removing the two-child limit would be the most cost-effective poverty reduction approach. He discusses how PolicyEngine's accessibility improved the efficiency of NIESR's analysis and communication of findings.
