Max Mosley, Senior Economist at the New Economics Foundation and formerly Senior Economist at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR), presents how PolicyEngine was integrated into NIESR's UK Living Standards Review 2025. The review revealed stark findings about UK economic stagnation: the poorest households in Slovenia and Malta are now better off than the poorest in the UK, real income growth has been among the slowest in Europe, and weak productivity is costing UK workers thousands of pounds per year. While real incomes grew consistently before the financial crisis, the stagnation afterwards has meant other countries have overtaken the UK standard of living. The UK now ranks as neither a high wage nor high welfare country, with welfare covering the cost of essentials in only two of the last fourteen years.

Mosley demonstrates how PolicyEngine enabled NIESR to analyse policy interventions with precision and speed. The platform was particularly valuable for evaluating poverty reduction measures, including analysis showing that removing the two-child limit would be the most cost-effective way to reduce poverty, lifting households out of deprivation while allowing direct comparison of fiscal impacts across alternative policy designs. He discusses how PolicyEngine's accessibility and transparency improved both the efficiency of NIESR's analysis and the communication of findings to policymakers and the public, providing a real-world example of how open-source microsimulation tools complement traditional economic research workflows at established institutions.
