Max Mosley, Senior Economist at the New Economics Foundation and formerly at NIESR, presents how PolicyEngine supported NIESR's UK Living Standards Review 2025. Mosley demonstrates how PolicyEngine enabled NIESR to analyse policy interventions, particularly poverty reduction measures. Analysis compared cost per person lifted from poverty of policies such as removing the two-child limit. He discusses how PolicyEngine's accessibility improved the efficiency of NIESR's analysis and communication of findings.
