Max Ghenis opens the event by introducing PolicyEngine as a nonprofit providing free, open-source microsimulation tools that make sophisticated tax and benefit policy analysis accessible to policymakers, researchers, journalists, and citizens. He describes PolicyEngine UK as the UK's only open-source tax-benefit microsimulation model, built on the OpenFisca framework, combining an intuitive web interface with a sophisticated engine processing millions of policy reforms in real-time. The platform uses the Family Resources Survey enhanced through fusion with other datasets and machine learning techniques. Ghenis announces the Nuffield Foundation's transformative support in December 2024, enabling the UK model to expand with local authority and constituency datasets, integration of childcare subsidies and major public services, an open validation dashboard, and AI-capable design improvements.

Ghenis highlights PolicyEngine's growing impact: formal recognition from HM Treasury, rapid analysis of major policy moments, and expansion to cover all 50 US states with comprehensive tax-benefit modeling. The organization has expanded into environmental policy with carbon tax modeling, firm-level microsimulation for VAT analysis, and behavioral response modeling. He previews the day's agenda, explaining how PolicyEngine 2.0—with AI-powered explanations, enhanced user experience, and expanded analytical capabilities—represents a transformative step toward making evidence-based policy analysis an integral part of democratic discourse.
