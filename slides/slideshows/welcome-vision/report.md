Max Ghenis presents PolicyEngine's journey from its origins at the UBI Centre in 2020 to becoming an independent nonprofit in 2021. The presentation traces key milestones: early policy scoring demonstrations in the UK, expansion to the US in March 2022, building rigourous economic simulation with representative datasets, and launching multiple access surfaces including the Python package and AI summarisation in 2023. Ghenis highlights growing adoption by organisations including the Green Party, Centre for Policy Studies, NIESR, IEA, Social Market Foundation, Liberal Democrats, and UK in a Changing Europe, culminating in HM Treasury piloting PolicyEngine UK in March 2025. He announces the Nuffield Foundation's grant enabling expansion with childcare integration, public services modelling, local datasets, validation dashboards, and AI-enhanced design.
