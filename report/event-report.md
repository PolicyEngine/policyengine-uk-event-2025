## Scope of the Model: Rules, Data, and Dynamics

**Speaker: Vahid Ahmadi**

Vahid Ahmadi provides a comprehensive overview of PolicyEngine UK's modeling scope, detailing the extensive range of tax and benefit rules encoded in the platform. This presentation covers how PolicyEngine captures the full complexity of the UK fiscal system, from income tax and National Insurance to Universal Credit, Council Tax support, childcare programs (Tax-Free Childcare, Extended childcare entitlement, Universal childcare entitlement, Targeted childcare entitlement, and Care to Learn), and numerous other means-tested and universal programs. Ahmadi explains the methodology for maintaining an accurate, up-to-date representation of current policy while preserving the flexibility to simulate any hypothetical reform through the platform's modular architecture built on OpenFisca.

The session explores PolicyEngine's sophisticated data enhancement capabilities, representing one of its most technically advanced features. Ahmadi details how the platform addresses fundamental challenges in microsimulation: under-sampling of demographic groups and measurement errors including underreporting of income and benefits. Using machine learning techniques—specifically random forest algorithms for imputation and gradient descent optimization for reweighting—PolicyEngine enhances the Family Resources Survey by fusing it with the Wealth and Assets Survey and Living Costs and Food Survey, correcting underrepresentation of high-income households and significantly reducing deviations from official statistics. He explains the platform's behavioral response modeling, which incorporates key elasticities for income effects on labour supply, substitution effects on labour supply, and capital gains tax responses, with all parameters customizable by users. Ahmadi demonstrates how PolicyEngine's recent Capital Gains Tax analysis showed behavioral modeling projected substantially lower five-year revenue compared to static analysis, illustrating the critical importance of capturing how individuals adjust economic decisions when facing new incentives.

## Localising Policy Impact: Parliamentary Constituencies & Local Authorities

**Speaker: Nikhil Woodruff**

Nikhil Woodruff presents PolicyEngine's groundbreaking local area modeling framework, which estimates the impact of UK tax and benefit policies at the level of parliamentary constituencies and local authorities—a capability that transforms how policymakers understand the geographical distribution of policy effects. The system reweights national Family Resources Survey data to match administrative statistics on income, employment, and population for each local area, creating household weights that maintain consistency with national totals while reflecting local characteristics. Woodruff explains the sophisticated methodology that integrates data from HMRC, ONS, ASHE, and the House of Commons Library, using gradient-based optimization to calibrate over 11,000 targets covering income brackets, age bands, and employment patterns across all constituencies and local authorities.

The presentation demonstrates the interactive dashboard that allows users to explore local area data and compare impacts across regions, supporting analysis of income, consumption, wealth, taxes, benefits, and fiscal impacts at the constituency and local authority level. Woodruff showcases practical applications, including how Members of Parliament can understand how proposed reforms would affect their specific constituencies, and how local authorities can assess the implications of benefit changes for their communities. He explains the technical challenges of producing geographically granular analysis while maintaining statistical validity, and demonstrates how this local dimension adds crucial context to national policy debates. The framework represents a significant advance in UK policy analysis, enabling evidence-based discussions that account for regional variation in economic circumstances, demographic composition, and policy impacts.

## NIESR's Use of PolicyEngine in its Living Standards Review

**Speaker: Max Mosley**

Max Mosley, Senior Economist at the New Economics Foundation and formerly Senior Economist at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR), presents how PolicyEngine was integrated into NIESR's UK Living Standards Review 2025. The review revealed stark findings about UK economic stagnation: the poorest households in Slovenia and Malta are now better off than the poorest in the UK, real income growth has been among the slowest in Europe, and weak productivity is costing UK workers thousands of pounds per year. While real incomes grew consistently before the financial crisis, the stagnation afterwards has meant other countries have overtaken the UK standard of living. The UK now ranks as neither a high wage nor high welfare country, with welfare covering the cost of essentials in only two of the last fourteen years.

Mosley demonstrates how PolicyEngine enabled NIESR to analyze policy interventions with precision and speed. The platform was particularly valuable for evaluating poverty reduction measures, including analysis showing that removing the two-child limit would be the most cost-effective way to reduce poverty, lifting households out of deprivation while allowing direct comparison of fiscal impacts across alternative policy designs. He discusses how PolicyEngine's accessibility and transparency improved both the efficiency of NIESR's analysis and the communication of findings to policymakers and the public, providing a real-world example of how open-source microsimulation tools complement traditional economic research workflows at established institutions.

## Microsimulation of a Carbon Dividend

**Speaker: Malcolm Torry**

Malcolm Torry, formerly General Manager of the Basic Income Earth Network and Senior Visiting Fellow at the London School of Economics, presents PolicyEngine's application to carbon tax and dividend proposals—an innovative approach where carbon tax revenue funds unconditional payments to every individual rather than being used for general government spending. Drawing on PolicyEngine's microsimulation capabilities developed by Nikhil Woodruff, Max Ghenis, and Vahid Ahmadi, Torry analyzes two scenarios: a £100 per tonne carbon tax funding an unconditional dividend of £18.60 per week, and a £200 per tonne tax funding £37.40 per week. He explains how carbon dividends address a critical policy challenge—ensuring that carbon taxes don't reduce household disposable incomes, particularly for lower-income families who spend proportionally more on energy.

The presentation reveals a fundamental tension in climate policy design: while both carbon tax scenarios redistribute from rich to poor (as wealthy households consume more carbon-intensive goods), PolicyEngine's microsimulation shows they would impose large income losses on too many low-income households to be politically feasible. Torry demonstrates how this distributional analysis informs the search for viable solutions, suggesting that a hybrid approach—combining a carbon tax with reforms to existing taxes and benefits—could achieve environmental goals while protecting vulnerable households. He references his broader Basic Income research using PolicyEngine, which identified feasible schemes meeting strict criteria including revenue neutrality within £2 billion, no more than 2% of low-income households experiencing losses above 5%, and substantial reductions in poverty and inequality. This work exemplifies how microsimulation reveals the political economy of climate policy by showing precisely which households win and lose under different policy designs.

## VAT Analysis with Synthetic Firm Microdata

**Speaker: Vahid Ahmadi**

Vahid Ahmadi presents PolicyEngine's first application of firm-level microsimulation to UK tax policy, analyzing how VAT threshold changes between £70,000 and £120,000 would affect government revenues and VAT-registered businesses in 2026-27. This groundbreaking work addresses a critical gap in traditional microsimulation models by expanding beyond household-level analysis to incorporate business-side tax impacts. Ahmadi explains the methodology for constructing synthetic firm microdata through multi-objective optimization, calibrated to match both ONS UK Business statistics for overall firm distributions and HMRC VAT statistics for registered businesses. The model captures firms by industry classification, turnover bands, employee counts, and VAT tax liability while protecting sensitive business information.

The presentation showcases validation results showing PolicyEngine's estimates deviate an average of only 12.3% from HMRC's official projections across 2024-29, demonstrating the model's accuracy. Ahmadi reveals key findings from the analysis: raising the threshold to £100,000 would remove approximately 48,000 firms from VAT registration and reduce revenue by £371 million, while a £70,000 threshold would add 109,000 firms and generate £642 million additional revenue. He discusses observed distributions showing density drops above both the £90,000 VAT threshold and the £150,000 VAT Flat Rate Scheme limit. Ahmadi previews upcoming applications of this capability to sector-specific thresholds, phase-in mechanisms, and policies addressing cliff effects where businesses deliberately constrain growth to avoid VAT registration—demonstrating how firm-level microsimulation provides a more complete picture of tax policy impacts.

## PolicyEngine US: Modelling Federal, State, and Local Policies

**Speaker: Max Ghenis**

Max Ghenis presents PolicyEngine's US operations, which expanded rapidly in 2024 to achieve comprehensive coverage of American tax and benefit policy. A flagship achievement was the launch of the household-by-household interactive for the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), which allowed users to explore the legislation's effects on over 40,000 representative households using PolicyEngine's Enhanced Current Population Survey data. Ghenis demonstrates the interactive's "Get Random Household" function, which reveals how the same policy affects different families across America's diverse population, with each household weighted by population representation to ensure realistic coverage. This capability showcases PolicyEngine's ability to deliver real-time, detailed analysis of complex legislation in ways that make policy impacts tangible and accessible.

The presentation highlights PolicyEngine US's comprehensive scope, achieved in 2024: federal tax and benefit programs including SNAP, TANF, childcare subsidies, and housing assistance; complete income tax models for all 50 states and DC; and specialized tools like the SALT-AMT calculator and GiveCalc for charitable giving analysis. Ghenis showcases the Enhanced Current Population Survey, which integrates IRS data and Congressional Budget Office forecasts using machine learning to enable accurate tax-benefit microsimulation. He discusses PolicyEngine's analysis of numerous Congressional proposals including the American Family Act and Tax Relief for Workers Act, partnerships with organizations like the Niskanen Center for Child Tax Credit research, and state-level work in Montana, Utah, New York, and Louisiana. The presentation demonstrates how PolicyEngine US handles the complexity of multi-jurisdictional American fiscal policy—from federal-state interactions to local tax variations—establishing the platform as a leading resource for evidence-based policy analysis across all levels of government. Ghenis notes recognition from the academic community, including presentations at the National Tax Association, APPAM, and universities including UC Berkeley and Northwestern.

This expansion has been supported by major grants from leading foundations and agencies. The National Science Foundation awarded PolicyEngine $300,000 through its Pathways to Enable Open-Source Ecosystems (POSE) program to strengthen organizational infrastructure and community engagement around economic policy analysis tools. Arnold Ventures has provided multiple awards supporting state and congressional district policy breakdowns, specialized calculators for SALT and AMT policies, and labor supply response modeling. MyFriendBen contracted PolicyEngine to power its benefit eligibility screener with comprehensive API support, while NEO Philanthropy provided general operating support through its Economic Mobility & Opportunity Fund. These partnerships demonstrate growing recognition of PolicyEngine's role in democratizing sophisticated policy analysis across the United States.

## Looking Ahead: AI-Powered Policy Analysis

**Speakers: Max Ghenis, Nikhil Woodruff, Vahid Ahmadi**

The PolicyEngine team concludes the event with a live demonstration of their multi-agent AI research workflow, recently tested on policy analysis tasks similar to their UK carbon dividend study. Using Claude Code's multi-agent system, PolicyEngine has configured specialized agents that automate different parts of the policy analysis pipeline: a data fetching agent that accesses PolicyEngine microsimulation data from GitHub repositories and documentation, a script writer that generates Python code using the policyengine-uk package, and a report generator that produces formatted research output with Plotly visualizations. The speakers demonstrate how Claude Code automatically routes tasks to appropriate agents based on natural language requests, showing real-time policy analysis without manual coordination between components.

The presentation candidly addresses both successes and limitations discovered during testing. The team found that multi-agent workflows excel at standard distributional analyses—calculating poverty rates, Gini coefficients, and decile-level impacts—saving significant time on repetitive tasks while maintaining PolicyEngine's house style. However, they reveal challenges with complex benefit program interactions, the need for precise prompting rather than generic instructions, and the importance of specialized reviewer agents for meaningful code critique. The speakers announce the forthcoming policyengine-claude plugin, which packages these insights for other researchers using Claude Code with PolicyEngine, incorporating Anthropic's Skills ecosystem for common policy analyses and direct database access through the Model Context Protocol. They emphasize the right division of labor: AI handles routine policy updates with constant analysis structures, while human researchers focus on questions requiring genuine policy expertise, complex methodological choices, and political context—ensuring that advancing AI serves to augment rather than replace expert judgment in evidence-based policymaking.
