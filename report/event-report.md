## Welcome and Vision

**Speaker: Max Ghenis**

Max Ghenis opens the event by introducing PolicyEngine as a nonprofit providing free, open-source microsimulation tools that make tax and benefit policy analysis accessible to policymakers, researchers, journalists, and citizens. He describes PolicyEngine UK as the UK's only open-source tax-benefit microsimulation model, built on the OpenFisca framework, combining a web interface with an engine processing millions of policy reforms in real-time. The platform uses the Family Resources Survey enhanced through fusion with other datasets and machine learning techniques. Ghenis announces the Nuffield Foundation's support in December 2024, enabling the UK model to expand with local authority and constituency datasets, integration of childcare subsidies and major public services, an open validation dashboard, and AI-capable design improvements.

Ghenis highlights PolicyEngine's growing impact: formal recognition from HM Treasury, rapid analysis of major policy moments, and expansion to cover all 50 US states with comprehensive tax-benefit modelling. The organisation has expanded into environmental policy with carbon tax modelling, firm-level microsimulation for VAT analysis, and behavioural response modelling. He previews the day's agenda, explaining how PolicyEngine 2.0—with AI-powered explanations, enhanced user experience, and expanded analytical capabilities—aims to make evidence-based policy analysis an integral part of democratic discourse.

## Technology and AI for UK Policymaking: The PolicyEngine Approach

**Speakers: Max Ghenis & Nikhil Woodruff**

Max Ghenis and Nikhil Woodruff present how PolicyEngine leverages artificial intelligence and modern software architecture for UK policy analysis. The presentation covers PolicyEngine's AI product launches in 2024: AI-powered explanations (March 2024) using GPT-4 to translate tax calculations into plain English, and the conversational policy interface (October 2024) enabling natural language queries about household impacts. The speakers demonstrate how LLM coding agents accelerate development of tax-benefit reforms and data work, and how machine learning techniques—quantile random forests for imputation and gradient descent for calibration—enhance data quality.

## Scope of the Model: Policies, Households, and Dynamics

**Speaker: Vahid Ahmadi**

Vahid Ahmadi provides a comprehensive overview of PolicyEngine UK's modelling scope, detailing the extensive range of tax and benefit rules encoded in the platform. This presentation covers how PolicyEngine captures the full complexity of the UK fiscal system, from income tax and National Insurance to Universal Credit, Council Tax support, childcare programs (Tax-Free Childcare, Extended childcare entitlement, Universal childcare entitlement, Targeted childcare entitlement, and Care to Learn), and numerous other means-tested and universal programs. Ahmadi explains the methodology for maintaining an accurate, up-to-date representation of current policy while preserving the flexibility to simulate any hypothetical reform through the platform's modular architecture built on OpenFisca.

The session explores PolicyEngine's data enhancement capabilities. Ahmadi details how the platform addresses challenges in microsimulation: under-sampling of demographic groups and measurement errors including underreporting of income and benefits. Using machine learning techniques—specifically random forest algorithms for imputation and gradient descent optimisation for reweighting—PolicyEngine enhances the Family Resources Survey by fusing it with the Wealth and Assets Survey and Living Costs and Food Survey, correcting underrepresentation of high-income households and reducing deviations from official statistics. He explains the platform's behavioural response modelling, which incorporates key elasticities for income effects on labour supply, substitution effects on labour supply, and capital gains tax responses, with all parameters customisable by users. Ahmadi demonstrates how PolicyEngine's recent Capital Gains Tax analysis showed behavioural modelling projected lower five-year revenue compared to static analysis, illustrating how individuals adjust economic decisions when facing new incentives.

## Localising Policy Impact: Parliamentary Constituencies & Local Authorities

**Speaker: Nikhil Woodruff**

Nikhil Woodruff presents PolicyEngine's local area modelling framework, which estimates the impact of UK tax and benefit policies at the level of parliamentary constituencies and local authorities. The system reweights national Family Resources Survey data to match administrative statistics on income, employment, and population for each local area, creating household weights that maintain consistency with national totals while reflecting local characteristics. Woodruff explains the methodology that integrates data from HMRC, ONS, ASHE, and the House of Commons Library, using gradient-based optimisation to calibrate over 11,000 targets covering income brackets, age bands, and employment patterns across all constituencies and local authorities.

The presentation demonstrates the interactive dashboard that allows users to explore local area data and compare impacts across regions, supporting analysis of income, consumption, wealth, taxes, benefits, and fiscal impacts at the constituency and local authority level. Woodruff showcases practical applications, including how Members of Parliament can understand how proposed reforms would affect their specific constituencies, and how local authorities can assess the implications of benefit changes for their communities. He explains the technical challenges of producing geographically granular analysis while maintaining statistical validity, and demonstrates how this local dimension adds context to national policy debates. The framework enables evidence-based discussions that account for regional variation in economic circumstances, demographic composition, and policy impacts.

## NIESR's Use of PolicyEngine in its Living Standards Review

**Speaker: Max Mosley**

Max Mosley, Senior Economist at the New Economics Foundation and formerly Senior Economist at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR), presents how PolicyEngine was integrated into NIESR's UK Living Standards Review 2025. The review revealed stark findings about UK economic stagnation: the poorest households in Slovenia and Malta are now better off than the poorest in the UK, real income growth has been among the slowest in Europe, and weak productivity is costing UK workers thousands of pounds per year. While real incomes grew consistently before the financial crisis, the stagnation afterwards has meant other countries have overtaken the UK standard of living. The UK now ranks as neither a high wage nor high welfare country, with welfare covering the cost of essentials in only two of the last fourteen years.

Mosley demonstrates how PolicyEngine enabled NIESR to analyse policy interventions with precision and speed. The platform was particularly valuable for evaluating poverty reduction measures, including analysis showing that removing the two-child limit would be the most cost-effective way to reduce poverty, lifting households out of deprivation while allowing direct comparison of fiscal impacts across alternative policy designs. He discusses how PolicyEngine's accessibility and transparency improved both the efficiency of NIESR's analysis and the communication of findings to policymakers and the public, providing a real-world example of how open-source microsimulation tools complement traditional economic research workflows at established institutions.

## Microsimulation of a Carbon Dividend

**Speaker: Malcolm Torry**

Malcolm Torry, formerly General Manager of the Basic Income Earth Network and Senior Visiting Fellow at the London School of Economics, presents PolicyEngine's application to carbon tax and dividend proposals—an approach where carbon tax revenue funds unconditional payments to every individual rather than being used for general government spending. Drawing on PolicyEngine's microsimulation capabilities developed by Nikhil Woodruff, Max Ghenis, and Vahid Ahmadi, Torry analyses two scenarios: a £100 per tonne carbon tax funding an unconditional dividend of £18.60 per week, and a £200 per tonne tax funding £37.40 per week. He explains how carbon dividends address the question of how carbon taxes affect household disposable incomes, particularly for lower-income families who spend proportionally more on energy.

The presentation shows how PolicyEngine's microsimulation quantifies distributional impacts: while both carbon tax scenarios redistribute from rich to poor (as wealthy households consume more carbon-intensive goods), the analysis reveals that some low-income households would experience income losses. Torry demonstrates how this distributional analysis can inform policy design, suggesting that a hybrid approach—combining a carbon tax with reforms to existing taxes and benefits—represents one alternative. He references his broader Basic Income research using PolicyEngine, which identified schemes meeting specific criteria including revenue neutrality within £2 billion, no more than 2% of low-income households experiencing losses above 5%, and reductions in poverty and inequality. This work demonstrates how microsimulation shows precisely which households gain and lose under different policy designs.

## VAT Analysis with Synthetic Firm Microdata

**Speaker: Vahid Ahmadi**

Vahid Ahmadi presents PolicyEngine's first application of firm-level microsimulation to UK tax policy, analysing how VAT threshold changes between £70,000 and £120,000 would affect government revenues and VAT-registered businesses in 2026-27. This work expands beyond household-level analysis to incorporate business-side tax impacts. Ahmadi explains the methodology for constructing synthetic firm microdata through multi-objective optimisation, calibrated to match both ONS UK Business statistics for overall firm distributions and HMRC VAT statistics for registered businesses. The model captures firms by industry classification, turnover bands, employee counts, and VAT tax liability while protecting sensitive business information.

The presentation showcases validation results showing PolicyEngine's estimates deviate an average of only 12.3% from HMRC's official projections across 2024-29, demonstrating the model's accuracy. Ahmadi reveals key findings from the analysis: raising the threshold to £100,000 would remove approximately 48,000 firms from VAT registration and reduce revenue by £371 million, while a £70,000 threshold would add 109,000 firms and generate £642 million additional revenue. He discusses observed distributions showing density drops above both the £90,000 VAT threshold and the £150,000 VAT Flat Rate Scheme limit. Ahmadi previews upcoming applications of this capability to sector-specific thresholds, phase-in mechanisms, and policies addressing cliff effects where businesses deliberately constrain growth to avoid VAT registration—demonstrating how firm-level microsimulation provides a more complete picture of tax policy impacts.

## PolicyEngine US: Tools for Deconstructing Complex Policies

**Speakers: Daphne Hansell & David Trimmer**

Daphne Hansell and David Trimmer demonstrate PolicyEngine US's household-level analysis tools through two recent applications. They present the household-by-household interactive for the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), which allows users to explore the legislation's effects on over 40,000 representative households using PolicyEngine's Enhanced Current Population Survey data. The interactive's "Get Random Household" function reveals how the same policy affects different families across America's diverse population, with each household weighted by population representation.

The speakers also showcase PolicyEngine's household view of enhanced ACA subsidies, demonstrating how the platform enables users to understand health insurance subsidy impacts at the individual household level. These tools make policy impacts tangible by showing real effects on specific family types rather than aggregate statistics alone.
